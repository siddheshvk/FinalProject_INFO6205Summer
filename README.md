# Neural Network

## Description
Neural network based on Object Orientend Principals JAVA. Developed as a final project for the Program Structures and Algorithms course(Summer 2018). 
The Neural network developed was trained and tested on the hand written digits database(MNIST database) and was henced used to detect the digits. The object state and all the neural network paramters that are calculated during training of model are saved using DB4O utility. The state is revived back when the application loads.

## Introduction
Neural Network is a computational model based on the structure and functions of biological neural networks. Information that flows through the network affects the structure of the neural network because a neural network changes - or learns, in a sense - based on that input and output.
The most important advantage of neural networks is that it can actually learn from observing datasets. Neural Network can be used as a random function approximation tool which help estimate methods for arriving at solutions while defining computing functions or distributions. ANNs have three layers that are interconnected. The first layer consists of input neurons. Those neurons send data on to the second layer, which in turn sends the output neurons to the third layer. Training an artificial neural network involves choosing from allowed models for which there are several associated algorithms.
